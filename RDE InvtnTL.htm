                                    Since General Electric (GE) invented synthetic diamond in 1955, 
                                    material processing has undergone revolutionary changes, bringing us new materials.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the beginning of 1960’s, three institutes under the then Ministry of Machinery 
                                    Industry of China: Zhengzhou Research Institute for Abrasives and Grinding, 
                                    Jinan Foundry and Metalforming Machinery Research Institute, and Hefei General 
                                    Machinery Research Institute started joint research on synthetic diamonds. 
                                    In 1963, they made China’s first synthetic diamonds. In 1967, Cubic Boron Nitride 
                                    (CBN) was first produced. In 1974, Xi’an Branch of China Coal Research Institute 
                                    successfully developed synthetic diamond drill bits, ushering in a new era of 
                                    industrial application of synthetic diamonds in China.
                                </p>

                                    In 1996, Baoding BADA and WINTER set up a joint venture. Despite its failure in 
                                    business, it has remarkably improved the quality of China’s synthetic 
                                    monocrystalline diamonds. Since then, Zhongnan Diamond Co., Ltd. and Huanghe Whirlwind
                                     Co., Ltd. have dominated the global market. The production output of synthetic diamond
                                      in China now accounts for 90% of the world market.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   From 1999 to 2007, China’s renowned producers overcame technical bottlenecks in making 
                                   multicrystalline diamonds, CBN, micron diamond powders, and micron CBN powders. They
                                    developed a wider range of products and began wholesale industrial application. Their 
                                    products rapidly dominated the international market.

                                    In 2012, China’s polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDC) for drilling were already of 
                                    the highest quality in the world. They took the place of imported PDCs in the domestic
                                     market and entered the world market.
