                                    Tungsten carbide matrix strongly supports diamond surface. We manufacture custom sizes and can provide custom shapes and sizes to meet 
                                    our clients satisfaction.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Bond Interface</b><br />
                                    A lot of different bonding-pattern interfaces are formed between the tungsten carbide matrix and the diamond layer. This strengthens their
                                    bonding strength. Generally, a larger contact surface with elements evenly distributed, symmetric and forms an circular arc, enhances the 
                                    bonding strength.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Diamond Surface</b><br />
                                    Diamond surface should be the hardest and the most abrasive resistant material in the world. The diamond layer thickness varies by 
                                    requirements and manufacture technology level.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Diamond Layer Chamfer</b><br />
                                    Diamond layer has to be chamfered accordingly, so PDC cutters can improve cutting ability and durability under different drilling conditions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Tungsten Carbide Chamfer</b><br />
                                    The bottom chamfered tungsten carbide enlarges the contact area between PDC cutters and
                                    drill bit body. This contact area not only increases the brazing and sintering strength, but also reduces stress concentration.

                                    <b>Diamond Surface Polishing</b><br />
                                    The diamond surface polishing is a technique used to reduce friction against rock debris. Our highly abrasive resistant PDC cutters 
                                    make the polishing unnecessary.
                                </p>

                                    <h3>PDC Cutter Working Principle</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    1. In formations where rocks are plastic, when under drilling pressure and torque from PDC cutter diamond edges, rocks crack internally 
                                    or flow plastically. Then, they break down and becomes debris. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. In brittle formations, the PDC cutters cause those brittle rocks to rupture. PDC cutters fracture the rock by strain and 
                                    shear force which results the drills' penetration rate to be higher.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. In hard and abrasive formations, the flat diamond surfaces of PDC cutters are not strong enough to withstand 
                                    the pressure and impact. They will start chipping, spalling or delaminating. The dome shaped PDC cutters are used to solve this problem. 
                                    Their cambered surfaces can help to fracture the rock first. Although dome shaped of PDC cutters can last longer than flat ones, 
                                    their penetration rate is lower.
                                </p>

                                    PDC cutters' cutting mechanism is shearing, pressing and scraping. The main characteristics of wear mode are friction 
									wear and fragmentation wear, besides thermal wear by diamond carbonization caused by inadequate cooling or in deep hard formation.
                                </p>

                                    If PDC cutter cuts a softer formation by virtue of shearing, pressing or scraping the diamond working edge surface 
									will be slightly plastically deformed and cause micro broken. This kind of wear is defined as friction wear (pure wear).
                                </p>

                                    If a PDC cutter is repeatedly impacted, pressed or scraped; and the heavy load stress is bigger than the deformation 
									limit of the diamond working edge surface, the transverse crack behind the edge surface will occur by a cumulative 
									residual stress, and then the crack propagation causes some local cutting edges separated, resulting in chipping 
									or spalling damage. This kind of wear is defined as fragmentation wear.
                                </p>

                                    Ideal Wear Mode is a characteristic of high performance PDC cutters. No matter how it drills the formation 
									that is suitable for PDC cutter working, it exhibits excellent impact ability and high wear resistance for 
									a long time. PDC cutter diamond working edge surface provides micro friction wear, in which it keeps the 
									initial or greater back angle, and the approximate plane or arc back surface all along.

                                    <h3>PDC Cutter Failure</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    The failure modes of PDC cutters are abrasion, fragmentation and delamination. 
PDC cutter's damage causes the failure of PDC drill bit, but its failures also include 
tooth column broken and bit body abrasive erosion etc. Under normal 
circumstances, PDC drill bit fails by the reaction force (moment)  of downhole 
rock and the rock debris abrasion. However, there are other causes of non-
normal damage of PDC cutter and PDC drill bit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>1. Gravel</b><br />
                                    As a PDC drill bit reaches agglomerate rock in gravel formation, the working edge surfaces usually breaks or delaminates.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>2. Hard Sandwich and Dip Formation</b><br />
                                    As a PDC drill bit enters hard sandwich or dip formation from softer one, the drill machine tends to jump back or seize up. 
									Some diamond working edge surfaces of PDC cutter in the bit crown will cause fracture, delamination or column broken due to 
									the extraordinary big impacts.
                                    <br /> 
                                    In addition, the reaction force mostly concentrates on the diamond working edge in hard formation; whereas in soft formation, 
									the force spreads on the whole diamond surface，therefore, PDC cutters are more likely to be damaged in hard formation than in soft one.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>3. Improper Parameters</b><br />
                                    If the specific hydraulic power is too high, the cut rock debris will causes excessively abrasion erosion on the bit body, 
									so that the teeth column or nozzle are easy to fall off. On the contrary, if the specific hydraulic power is too low, 
									PDC drill bits will be balled up, and then reducing cooling and cleaning efficiency, resulting in thermal abrasion on the 
									diamond working edge surface.
