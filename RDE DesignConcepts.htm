                                    Tungsten carbide matrix strongly supports diamond surface. We manufacture custom sizes and can provide custom shapes and sizes to meet 
                                    our clients satisfaction.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Bond Interface</b><br />
                                    A lot of different bonding-pattern interfaces are formed between the tungsten carbide matrix and the diamond layer. This strengthens their
                                    bonding strength. Generally, a larger contact surface with elements evenly distributed, symmetric and forms an circular arc, enhances the 
                                    bonding strength.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Diamond Surface</b><br />
                                    Diamond surface should be the hardest and the most abrasive resistant material in the world. The diamond layer thickness varies by 
                                    requirements and manufacture technology level.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Diamond Layer Chamfer</b><br />
                                    Diamond layer has to be chamfered accordingly, so PDC cutters can improve cutting ability and durability under different drilling conditions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Tungsten Carbide Chamfer</b><br />
                                    The bottom chamfered tungsten carbide enlarges the contact area between PDC cutters and
                                    drill bit body. This contact area not only increases the brazing and sintering strength, but also reduces stress concentration.

                                    <b>Diamond Surface Polishing</b><br />
                                    The diamond surface polishing is a technique used to reduce friction against rock debris. Our highly abrasive resistant PDC cutters 
                                    make the polishing unnecessary.
                                </p>

                                    <h3>PDC Cutter Working Principle</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    1. In formations where rocks are plastic, when under drilling pressure and torque from PDC cutter diamond edges, rocks crack internally 
                                    or flow plastically. Then, they break down and becomes debris. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. In brittle rock formations, the PDC cutters cause those brittle rocks to rupture. PDC cutters fracture the rock by strain and 
                                    shear force which results the drills' penetration rate to be higher.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. In hard and abrasive rock formations, the flat diamond surfaces of PDC cutters are not strong enough to withstand 
                                    the pressure and impact. They will start chipping, spalling or delaminating. The dome shaped PDC cutters are used to solve this problem. 
                                    Their cambered surfaces can help to fracture the rock first. Although dome shaped of PDC cutters can last longer than flat ones, 
                                    their penetration rate is lower.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    PDC cutters cut through rocks by shearing, pressing and scraping, so cutters can be worn by friction and fragmentation. 
                                    Due to inadequate cooling in deep hard rock formation, cutters can also be worn by high heat which causes diamond carbonization. 
                                </p>

                                    <b>Friction Wear</b><br />
                                    When PDC cutters cut through a softer formation, the diamond layer's edge will be plastically deformed slightly and worn out microscopically.
                                     This kind of wear is defined as friction wear or pure wear.
                                </p>

                                    When PDC cutters' load stress is greater than the deformation limit of its diamond edge surface, cross cracks behind the edge surface will occur by residual but cumulative 
                                    stress. Then, the cracks propagate and cause the cutting edges to break off, which results in chipping and even spalling damage. 
                                    This kind of wear is defined as fragmentation wear.
                                </p>

                                    Ideal wear mode is a characteristic of high performance PDC cutters. No matter the rock formations, they exhibit excellent impact ability and high wear resistance for 
                                    a long time. The diamond edge surface exhibit friction wear only microscopically. This wear mode keeps the initial or even greater back angle, 
                                    and the plane or arc back surface all along.

                                    As PDC cutters reach agglomerate rocks in hard and abrasive formation, the diamond edge surfaces usually break or delaminate.
                                </p>

                                    As PDC cutters enter hard sandwich or inclined formation from a softer layer, sudden extraordinary impacts occur. Some diamond 
                                    edge surfaces of PDC cutters will cause fracture, delamination.
