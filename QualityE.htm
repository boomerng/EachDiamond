                                    (SAM) is used to look for the defectives like flaws, delamination and holes hidden
                                    inside the products.

                                    Differential scanning calorimetry -Thermogravimetric - differential thermal 
analyzer (DSC-DTA ) . When heating PDC cutters in the oxidizing atmosphere, 
we measure the initial oxidation temperature, and mass loss rate and weight 
loss ratio to determine the degree of oxidation and heat resistance.

                                    <b>Wear Ratio</b><br />
                                    Wear Ratio (WR) is a form of expression of PDC cutter abrasion resistance. WR is 
defined as the ratio of the standard wheel weight loss to the PDC cutter diamond 
layer weight loss, after it is ground by the wheel. The larger the ratio, 
the higher the WR, the higher the abrasion resistance. Heat WR is the 
abrasion resistance after PDC cutter passes through a heat treatment, and it is 
used to determine the abrasion variation of PDC cutters.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Impact Strength</b><br />
                                    Impact Strength (IS) is the ability to resist impact fracture of PDC cutters, and we 
test it by using a method in which an impact load simulating underground 
drilling hits PDC cutter. The method is to let a ball free fall from a certain height 
and hit the central area of diamond layer surface repeatedly until 
there appears any flaw or break in the PDC cutter. Then we count the cumulative 
impact number; and calculate the impact Joule power per time and the 
accumulating power value that represents the impact toughness of the PDC cutter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But PDC cutter receiving the impact load is on the surface edge, instead of 
the centre in actual working process. So we invent an innovative test 
method for IS. We let a ball hit the outer circumference of a PDC cutter diamond 
surface.  According to probability statistic law, the impact points of the ball 
compose an outer circle line. This method most approaches the real 
condition of hitting PDC cutter.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Application Test</b><br />
                                    Each Diamond has developed a proprietary technology for application test. 
We install an engineering drill machine with power measurement on a 
giant platform. Firstly, make a drill bit using the PDC cutters to be tested. Secondly, 
drill a big and homogeneous crystal granite with the drill bit. During the 
drilling process, the bit will undergo, selectively or all, heavy-duty friction 
abrasion, impact abrasion, erosion and thermal abrasion. Lastly, receive a 
comprehensive evaluation of the PDC cutter overall performance including
durability and drilling rate etc. And the evaluation data can be used to score 
the validation and verification of the product. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Field Test</b><br />
                                    Finally, we test PDC cutters in real work environment. Geological formations 
are so complicated, and there are different choices of drill machines and 
drilling parameters. So only the test data in site can decide whether the 
product meets the user requirements or not. This is the final phase for 
valuing PDC cutters.
