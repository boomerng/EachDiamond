                                    The diamond micron powder we produce is top grade quality with equilateral shape and transparent crystal, standard size, narrow size distribution,

                                    of quality characteristics. Then, we design, and come up with a prototype. We do requirement testing, verification, validation and 
                                    identify its failure mode. When we are in our pre-production phase, we send our samples to our partners for in-field testing. We have 
                                    partners in different continents, which really helps the spread of the test results for further improvements. Only when we are satisfied
                                    with our results, we enter lot production.

                                    <b>Structure Inspection</b><br />
                                    The Optical Microscope Imaging Apparatus (OMIA) is used to precisely measure dimension of our products. 
                                    The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is used to probe its micron structure. The Scanning Acoustic Microscope
                                    (SAM) is used to look for the flaws, delamination and hollows in the products.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Thermal Stability Test</b><br />
                                    We perform differential scanning calorimetry - Thermogravimetric - differential thermal analyzer (DSC-DTA).
                                    When heating PDC cutters in the oxidizing atmosphere, we measure the initial oxidation temperature, mass loss rate and weight loss ratio 
                                    to determine the degree of oxidation and heat resistance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Wear Ratio</b><br />
                                    Wear Ratio (WR) is a form to measure PDC cutter's abrasion resistance. For PDC cutters ground by the wheel, WR is defined as the ratio of the standard wheel weight loss 
                                    to the PDC cutter diamond layer weight loss. The higher the ratio, the higher the abrasion resistance. Heat WR is the abrasion resistance 
                                    after PDC cutter passes through a heat treatment. It is used to determine the abrasion variation of PDC cutters.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Impact Strength</b><br />
                                    Impact Strength (IS) is the ability to resist impact fracture of PDC cutters. 
                                    We let a steel ball free fall from a certain height and hit the central area of diamond layer surface. We repeat this until flaw or breakage appear 
                                    on the cutter. We then sum up all impact powers from these trials as the impact strength of the PDC cutter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In order to better simulate impact on PDC cutters during drilling, we also perform tests by hitting the side of the PDC cutter. According to 
                                    probability statistic law, the impact points of the ball compose an outer circle line.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Application Test</b><br />
                                    Other than simulating the drilling process, Each Diamond has also developed a proprietary technology for actual application test. 
                                    We install a drill machine with power measurement on a giant platform. We first construct a drill bit with our PDC cutters. We then use it
                                    to drill on a homogeneous crystal granite. During the process, the bit will undergo through heavy-duty friction abrasion, impact, erosion 
                                    and thermal abrasion. With the collected data, we evaluate our PDC cutters' overall performance on durability and drilling rate, and validate
                                    if our PDC cutters are ready for field test.
                                </p>
