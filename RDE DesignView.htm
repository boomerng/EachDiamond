                                    It strongly supports the diamond working surface. It has various shapes and sizes

                                    There are a lot of bond interfaces with different patterns between 
tungsten carbide matrix and diamond working layer. The interface 
needs a larger contact surface, and the elements of surface topography should be
evenly distributed, symmetric, circular arc, so as to enhance the bond 
strength. 
                                </p>

                                    Diamond working surface is of the hardest and the most abrasive 
resistant material in the world. The diamond layer thickness varies with 
different requirements and the manufacture technology level.
                                </p>

                                    Diamond layer has to be chamfered to meet different drilling conditions to improve
                                    the cutting ability and prolong the durability.
                                </p>

                                    The chamfered bottom of tungsten carbide enlarges the contact area between PDC cutters and
                                    bit body, in order to increase the brazing or sintering strength. The bevel 
                                    facilitates reducing stress concentration.

                                    <b>Diamond Working Surface Polishing</b><br />
                                    We used to polish the diamond working surface to reduce friction against 
rock debris, and prolong its service life. But the highly abrasive resistance 
of the latest PDC cutters has made the polishing unnecessary. 
                                </p>

                                    <h3>PDC Cutter Working</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    1. In plastic formations where rock is plastic under stress, under moment and 
drilling pressure,  PDC cutter diamond working edge surface makes the fore rock 
break up internally or flow plastically. Then those rocks break off from the 
rock matrix to form debris. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. In brittle formations, the stress of PDC cutter diamond working edge surface causes the rock’s brittle rupture. 
									As PDC cutter fractures the rock by strain and shear force, the penetration rate is higher.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. In hard and abrasive formations, the planar diamond surface of PDC cutters is not hard enough to resist 
									the high pressure and impact, and it is likely to produce chipping wear, spalling wear, or even delamination. 
									The domed PDC cutters can be generally used to work in this case, because cambered surface fractures rock by 
									pressing and scraping. This kind of PDC cutters is not likely to be broken, but has lower penetration rate.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    PDC cutter cutting mechanism is shearing, pressing and scraping. The main characteristics of wear mode are friction 
									wear and fragmentation wear, besides thermal wear by diamond carbonization caused by inadequate cooling or in deep hard formation.
                                </p>

                                    If PDC cutter cuts a softer formation by virtue of shearing, pressing or scraping the diamond working edge surface 
									will be slightly plastically deformed and cause micro broken. This kind of wear is defined as friction wear (pure wear).
                                </p>

                                    If a PDC cutter is repeatedly impacted, pressed or scraped; and the heavy load stress is bigger than the deformation 
									limit of the diamond working edge surface, the transverse crack behind the edge surface will occur by a cumulative 
									residual stress, and then the crack propagation causes some local cutting edges separated, resulting in chipping 
									or spalling damage. This kind of wear is defined as fragmentation wear.
                                </p>

                                    Ideal Wear Mode is a characteristic of high performance PDC cutters. No matter how it drills the formation 
									that is suitable for PDC cutter working, it exhibits excellent impact ability and high wear resistance for 
									a long time. PDC cutter diamond working edge surface provides micro friction wear, in which it keeps the 
									initial or greater back angle, and the approximate plane or arc back surface all along.

                                    <h3>PDC Cutter Failure</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    The failure modes of PDC cutters are abrasion, fragmentation and delamination. 
PDC cutter's damage causes the failure of PDC drill bit, but its failures also include 
tooth column broken and bit body abrasive erosion etc. Under normal 
circumstances, PDC drill bit fails by the reaction force (moment)  of downhole 
rock and the rock debris abrasion. However, there are other causes of non-
normal damage of PDC cutter and PDC drill bit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>1. Gravel</b><br />
                                    As a PDC drill bit reaches agglomerate rock in gravel formation, the working edge surfaces usually breaks or delaminates.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>2. Hard Sandwich and Dip Formation</b><br />
                                    As a PDC drill bit enters hard sandwich or dip formation from softer one, the drill machine tends to jump back or seize up. 
									Some diamond working edge surfaces of PDC cutter in the bit crown will cause fracture, delamination or column broken due to 
									the extraordinary big impacts.
                                    <br /> 
                                    In addition, the reaction force mostly concentrates on the diamond working edge in hard formation; whereas in soft formation, 
									the force spreads on the whole diamond working surface，therefore, PDC cutters are more likely to be damaged in hard formation than in soft one.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>3. Improper Parameters</b><br />
                                    If the specific hydraulic power is too high, the cut rock debris will causes excessively abrasion erosion on the bit body, 
									so that the teeth column or nozzle are easy to fall off. On the contrary, if the specific hydraulic power is too low, 
									PDC drill bits will be balled up, and then reducing cooling and cleaning efficiency, resulting in thermal abrasion on the 
									diamond working edge surface.
